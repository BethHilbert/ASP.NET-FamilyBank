# Family Bank Web-based Application 

Family Bank is a web-based application which records saving, spending, interest, and wishes. The target audience is parents desiring to motivate kids to responsibly handle money. To encourage saving, it includes an interest calculator, a status bar summarizing principle/interest amounts, and the ability to track progress towards affording "wishes." Created October 2017. 


Features
--------------------
Transactions are recorded by date, amount, and description. Daily interest is calculated. 

Interest earned is clearly displayed. Once $10 in interest is earned, a graphic congratulations shows. Balance is displayed with a progress bar identifying principle amount and interest amount. 

The Wishlist includes a description, cost, affordability, and URL link. Affordable items are clearly marked and include how much money will remain after potential purchase. Items that are not-affordable show the amount of money still required and a progress bar. This wishlist is searchable by word and price.

A resource page includes games, articles, and financial calculators.
