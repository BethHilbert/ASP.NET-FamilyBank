# Family Banking Web-based Application 
# (using ASP.NET and C#)

Family Banking is a web-based application which records saving, spending, interest, and wishes. The target audience is parents desiring to motivate their kids to save. To encourage saving, it includes an interest calculator and the ability to track progress towards affording "wishes". Created October 2017. 


Features
--------------------
Transactions are recorded by date, amount, and description. Daily interest is calculated. 

Interest earned is clearly displayed. Once $10 in interest is earned, a graphic congratulations shows. Balance is displayed with a progress bar identifying principle amount and interest amount. 

The Wishlist includes a description, cost, affordability, and URL link. Affordable items are clearly marked and include how much money will remain after potential purchase. Items that are not-affordable show the amount of money still required and a progress bar. This wishlist is searchable by word and price.

A resource page includes games, articles, and financial calculators.


Tools
